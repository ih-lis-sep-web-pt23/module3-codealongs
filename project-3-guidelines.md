# Project #3 - MERN Web Application

## The Goal 🎯

**This is your final project, where you can show off all you’ve learned!**

During this project, you will be developing a **Full-stack application** using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.JS).

**This project will be carried out individually or in a group defined by you, you get to choose!**

## Important Dates 🗓️

### Pitch Presentation: Feb 21

Present at least 2 ideas to the LT and TA in order to decide which project you'll develop. After the pitches you can start working on the project.

### Project Start: Feb 24

We officially begin our project development!

**NOTE**: All labs need to be submitted by this date!

### MVP: March 13

You'll present your MVP - **Minimum Viable Product** - to the LT and TA. MVP means you should have a working project with your basic features working.

### Deploy: March 20

We'll deploy both frontend and backend together in order to have enough time to fix any problems that might appear after the deploy.

### Project Presentation: March 30

You'll present your final projects for everyone! At the end the class will vote on the projects in 4 categories: **Most Aesthetically Pleasing, Most Challenging Coding Wise, Most Original Idea** and **Best Overall!** More info on the presentation below.

## Project Weeks Schedule 👩‍💻

### Standups

We gather in circle and everyone should answer the following questions:
1. What did I do last class (or the last time you worked on the project)
2. What will I do today
3. What are my blockers

### Project Development

We focus totally in developing the projects and the LT and the TA will be here to help you! To get help request it using the ticketing system on Slack!

## Project Requirements ✅

1. Have a **SPA frontend**, built with **React**, consisting of multiple views and implementing all CRUD actions.
2. Have a **REST API backend** built with **ExpressJS**, **MongoDB** and **Mongoose**, that your React app will communicate with.
3. Have **2 database models or more**. Having one model for users is the first step. The other one (or more) models should represent the main functionality of your app.
4. Have a **REST API backend** with routes that perform **all CRUD actions for at least one model** (excluding the user model).
5. Incorporate an **external API**.
6. **Include sign-up, log-in and log-out functionality** with encrypted passwords and authorisation (logged-in users can do additional things).
7. Have **two separate repos on GitHub**. One repo is for your frontend React application and the other is for your backend REST API.
8. Have at least **2 commits per day** that you worked on for class days - it is not required to work outside of classes!
9. **Have a backend validation** and centralised error handling in your REST API.
10. **Be deployed online**, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
11. Present a MVP - Minimum Viable Product.
12. Present your project to the class by the end! 🚀

### Deliverables - by the end of module #3

1. A **working and deployed app** that **meets all technical requirements**, **built by you**.
2. The **URL** to the deployed **React app**.
3. The **two URLs** of your **GitHub repositories** (frontend and backend).
4. The URL of the **slides for your project presentation**.
5. Your **GitHub repos** must have a **README with the completed project documentation**.

### Presentation

1. Format: Talking with slides + project live demo
2. The demo must be made on the deployed site
3. Slides must be online (Canva, Google Slides, other of your choosing)
4. Presentation Structure:
	1. Title Slide - Project name and your name
	2. About Me: Present yourself
	3. Elevator Pitch: Present your project
	4. Technical Challenge: What was the hardest part and how did you overcome it
	5. Big Mistake: What was the biggest mistake and what did you learn
	6. Demo Link: You deployed version link should be on the final slide

### Tips:

1. Don't show your code, no one will read it;
2. If something doesn't work, don't focus on in;
3. Show your work and be proud of it;
6. Practice your presentation;
7. Have fun 🚀
